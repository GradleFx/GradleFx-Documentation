Where to start
==============

1. GradleFx is based on Gradle, so if you're completely new to Gradle start by going through their documentation: `http://www.gradle.org/documentation <http://www.gradle.org/documentation>`_
  | This documentation will give you a good overview of Gradle's features and some essential concepts which you'll need to get started with GradleFx.  
2. Once you have a good comprehension of Gradle, start going through the rest of the GradleFx documentation. This will save you some time afterwards.  
3. After all this, we have a set of sample projects for each kind of project. These will show you how to use the GradleFx properties and implement certain mechanisms. These can be found here `https://github.com/GradleFx/GradleFx-Examples <https://github.com/GradleFx/GradleFx-Examples>`_  
4. If you still have some questions, feedback, or having a problem while creating your build script, please let us know on our support forum: `http://support.gradlefx.org/ <http://support.gradlefx.org/>`_  
5. Found a bug while implementing your build script? Log it here: `https://github.com/GradleFx/GradleFx/issues <https://github.com/GradleFx/GradleFx/issues>`_
